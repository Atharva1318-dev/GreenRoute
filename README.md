## GreenRoute ðŸŒ± (Ongoing Project)

GreenRoute is an eco-friendly route planner in active development. It compares fastest vs low-carbon routes, estimates per-trip COâ‚‚ emissions (using Climatiq) and uses OpenRouteService for routing. Key features â€” protected dashboard, trip history, and achievement badges â€” are being built incrementally.

The user dashboard temporarily looks like this:
